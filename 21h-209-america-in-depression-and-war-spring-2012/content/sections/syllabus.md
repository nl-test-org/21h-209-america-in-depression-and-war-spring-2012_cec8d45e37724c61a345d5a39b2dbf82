Description
-----------

This course examines the transforming effect of two cataclysmic events in the twentieth century: the Great Depression and World War II. We will study the ways they both led to a major reordering of American politics and society. By focusing on how the government and the country dealt with these national crises, we will explore a significant moment in the evolution of American political culture. Throughout the semester, we will examine how ordinary people experienced depression and war and how those experiences changed their outlook on politics and the world around them. Topics include unemployment and economic decline, the rise of organized labor, New Deal politics, women in the war effort, the Japanese internment, the development of atomic science, and America as a world superpower.

This class will consist of a combination of lectures and discussions. You will be required to do the reading in advance and come prepared to talk about what you have read. To help facilitate discussion, occasionally you will gather primary documents from the library and/or the web. Class participation will count for 20%. In addition, you will also have two in-class tests each worth 20%. In addition, you must also write a 15-page research paper (40%).
